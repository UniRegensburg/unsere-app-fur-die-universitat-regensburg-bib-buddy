Bib Buddy offers a platform for concentrated literary work. For that, we create an open atmosphere for your thoughts and ideas during research. Our service makes your literary work as intuitive as never before!

## Functionality
### Your library
Bib Buddy offers the possibility to retrieve data for books by scanning their barcodes, typing their ISBNs or simply adding the data manually in a form. All books can be structured in shelves in your personal library inside the app. Naturally, that library is searchable.

### Your thoughts
To support mobile literature work, the app offers to save notes relating to a book either in textual form, with your usual formatting options (text style, alignment...) or in auditory form to quickly store a thought in your app.

### Sharing
With Bib Buddy you can share your data and notes about a book, a complete shelf or even your whole library as a bibTeX file. This file can be imported from Zotero or other literature software so you can make the best out of the thoughts you gathered within the app!
